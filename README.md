# CodinGame-Utils
Codingame https://www.codingame.com/ is a fun way of learning and improving your coding abilities. Some code pieces are needed in a recurrent manner, so I create this repo to retrieve them easily and to share them.
There is only Python3 code at the moment, please feel free to submit merge requests if you have useful pieces of code in other languages.
